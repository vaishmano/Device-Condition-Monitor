# Device-Condition-Monitor
Device Condition Monitor is a desktop application built in C++ (wxWidgets) that collects and logs device condition and usage metrics. The project demonstrates an end-to-end workflow — from data collection in a C++ UI to data visualization in Power BI, aligning with Siemens Energy’s focus on data-driven grid technology solutions.
